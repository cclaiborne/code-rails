# Watch This!
Watch and do the following:<br>
http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation?view=asciicast.
######Push your resulting app to Github.

This RailsCast is done with Rails 3.2. When you create your app you're going to want to make sure to use the same version of rails.

```
gem install rails -v 3.2.13```

```
rails _3.2.13_ new [appname]```

When the RailsCast suggests changing css values, put in your own values to see the change and get something you like.

If you really get stuck, clone the finished app from
GitHub, and just follow along closely with the code.
Use Rails 4.1, and try to figure out what is different
