- As the site owner, I want to delete a portfolio item so that I can keep the list focused on my best work
    - Ready for the sandbox?
    - Use what you've learned above.
    - Write spec for delete
    - Add the behaviors to the app to get that spec passing!
    - Hints:
      - Adding a "Destroy" link to the show view may be easier than deleting from the index view.
      - The scaffold code generated for Posts may be useful as a reference.
